I am a Ph.D. graduated in May 2024 in Mathematics at The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa. I also earned a Master's degree in Optimization and Statistics at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan in 2018.

I am interested in applications of Statistics, Optimization and Algorithms in Computation Biology, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning and Supply Chain. My research interests include algorithms in Large-Scale Optimization and Graph Theory, high-dimension Statistics and Convex Geometry, and methods of Statistic modeling such as hidden Markov model, random sequences model,...
 
I enjoy translating real-world problems into mathematical problems and solving by algorithms and computing them by using Python, R, or Matlab. By leveraging my deep mathematical knowledge alongside powerful computing and algorithm libraries, I can create elegant and effective solutions.

From Oct 2023-May 2024, I was a Data Science Intern in Management Reporting and Business Intelligence team at Volvo Trucks , Greensboro, North Carolina, US. 

Currently, I am looking for jobs: Data Science, Statistician, Operation Research, Supply Chain and Logistic, Machine Learning Engineering, Quantitative Analysis/Research, and Computational Science
